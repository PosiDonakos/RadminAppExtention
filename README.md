# RadminAppExtention
An application which uses Radmin's VPN functions but gives a way faster and easier approach to connect to other pcs. To use it you need to have Radmin installed in your pc.
So I created this program because Radmin is really slow when you want to transition fast for a pc to another.Moreover you could not save credentials and that made you type everything again and again.So I created a program that can read stored IPS with stored user and passwords so you can enter 1 or multiple pc in milliseconds just by pressing connect.
In case you got any questions feel free to ask me anything.
